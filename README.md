# Automatic Topic Modelling
## Task:
  To Categorize Quora questions into different topics required by the user automatically
## Dataset:
  In this project, we will be working with a dataset of over 400,000 quora questions that have no labeled cateogry, and attempting to find 20 cateogries to assign these questions to. The quora_questions.csv file is used for the topic modelling purpose.
## Approach:
  1. Imported the quora questions
  2. Create vectorized document using FT-IDF vectorization method
  3. Seggregated questions into 20 topics using Non Negative Matrix Vectorization
  4. Displayed top 15 probablistic words to give the topic name
  5. Quora questions are neatly presented under 20 different clusters(topics)
